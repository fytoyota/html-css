    <h1>Carbonara's history</h1>
    <h2>Italian's culture</h2>
    <p>Carbonara is most associated with Rome and the Lazio region, but as with so many Italian dishes, in Italy, its origin provokes much speculation and debate. Some connect it to pasta cacio e uova, a Neapolitan dish of pasta tossed with melted lard, beaten raw eggs, and cheese, as documented in Ippolito Cavalcanti's 1839 Neapolitan cookbook. Because the name comes from the word carbonaro, “coal burner,” some believe the dish was created as a hearty easy-to-make meal by men working outdoors for long periods. Others trace it to the Allied liberation of Rome in 1944, with American GIs bringing their daily ration of eggs and bacon to local restaurants to add to the limited Italian menu. Supporting this story is the first written reference to the dish in newspaper La Stampa in 1950, describing it as a dish prized by American servicemen. Shortly after, carbonara also appears in Elizabeth David’s classic 1954 book Italian Food.</p>
    <h3>Carbonara's modern variations</h3>
    <p>Carbonara remains a wildly popular dish not just throughout Italy but around the world and is subject to continuous tweaks by both chefs and home cooks. Notes Luca Di Leo, Global Vice President of Corporate Communications for Barilla, “One of the great traits of pasta is its extraordinary versatility. You can combine it with pretty much anything. Carbonara is a traditional recipe, but we should remain open to interpretations that allow us to tell a global story of diversity. Being such a fantastic condiment, carbonara lets you create different variations to the original recipe. A vegetarian person could have fun experimenting with a roasted artichoke instead of bacon, while a seafood enthusiast may opt for sautéed shrimp. A meat lover might even try to pair it with leftover barbecue, with the added bonus of fighting food waste! You can also make a great variation of carbonara with spices different from black pepper. In a nutshell: carbonara is a truly global recipe which, like all kinds of pasta, can help bring people together.”</p>
